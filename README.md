# Marvelverse
Marvelverse is a website where you can view Marvel comics, movies, and their details. The Marvel api is used to get the comic book data and I created my own api to get data for the movies.

# Features
View comic books for different MCU heros as well as other comics written by Marvel such as Alien, Conan, Star Wara, etc. You can check out all the movies in the MCU and view details for each which include, description, chronology, trailer, and a post-credit scene. The site is mobile responsive and works smoothly on all devices.

# Future Features
I am currently working on a few features that will make the user experience of this site much better. I want the user to be able to view comic book for any Marvel hero/villian they search for. Also, I want to improve my MCU api and add more in-depth information about each film and provide the user with all the data they need. The biggest feature I want to add is a discussion board for users to talk about anything Marvel and create a place for people to share questions or theories they have. 

# Build
This website is built with JavaScript, React, and SCSS.
